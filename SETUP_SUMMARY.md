# Branching and Push Ruleset - Setup Summary

This document summarizes the branching and push ruleset that has been established for the Warmup-Project repository.

## üìã What Was Implemented

### 1. Documentation Files

#### BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md
- **Purpose:** Complete guide to branch structure and workflow
- **Contents:**
  - Main branches: `main` (production) and `develop` (integration)
  - Supporting branches: feature, bugfix, hotfix, release
  - Branch naming conventions
  - Branch protection requirements
  - Commit message guidelines using Conventional Commits
  - Pull request workflow
  - Best practices and emergency procedures

#### CONTRIBUTING.md
- **Purpose:** Guidelines for contributing to the project
- **Contents:**
  - Getting started instructions
  - Development workflow
  - Pull request process
  - Coding standards
  - Commit message format
  - Code review process and checklist

#### README.md (Updated)
- Enhanced with quick links to all documentation
- Added development workflow section
- Included branch protection summary
- Added commit message guidelines reference

### 2. GitHub Configuration Files

#### .github/pull_request_template.md
- Structured PR template with sections for:
  - Description and type of change
  - Related issues
  - Changes made
  - Testing details
  - Checklist for PR authors
  - Breaking changes documentation

#### .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
- **bug_report.md:** Template for reporting bugs
- **feature_request.md:** Template for requesting features
- **config.yml:** Configuration for issue templates

#### .github/CODEOWNERS
- Defines code ownership for automated review requests
- Default owner: @CSE210-fa25-team09
- Special ownership for configuration and documentation files

#### .github/labeler.yml
- Auto-labels PRs based on changed files
- Categories: documentation, github-actions, configuration, dependencies, tests

#### .github/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md
- Step-by-step guide for setting up branch protection in GitHub UI
- Detailed configuration for `main` and `develop` branches
- Includes both traditional branch protection and new rulesets
- Verification steps and troubleshooting

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflow

#### .github/workflows/pr-checks.yml
Automated checks that run on every pull request:

**Jobs:**
1. **pr-validation**
   - Validates branch naming convention
   - Checks PR title format (conventional commits)
   - Verifies PR has a description
   - Detects merge conflicts

2. **commit-validation**
   - Validates commit messages follow conventional format
   - Provides warnings for non-compliant commits

3. **auto-label**
   - Automatically labels PRs based on changed files
   - Uses labeler.yml configuration

### 4. Other Files

#### .gitignore
- Prevents committing build artifacts, dependencies, logs, and temporary files
- Covers common patterns for various languages and tools

## üéØ Branch Naming Conventions

### Accepted Patterns
- `feature/<feature-name>` - New features
- `bugfix/<bug-name>` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/<hotfix-name>` - Emergency production fixes
- `release/<version>` - Release preparation
- `<username>/<feature-name>` - Personal feature branches
- `copilot/*` - GitHub Copilot branches

### Examples
```bash
feature/user-authentication
bugfix/fix-login-error
hotfix/critical-security-patch
release/v1.0.0
john/add-dashboard
```

## üîí Branch Protection Requirements

### For `main` Branch
- ‚úÖ Requires 2 approvals before merging
- ‚úÖ Requires all status checks to pass
- ‚úÖ Requires conversation resolution
- ‚úÖ Requires code owner review
- ‚úÖ No force pushes allowed
- ‚úÖ No direct pushes allowed
- ‚úÖ No branch deletion allowed

### For `develop` Branch
- ‚úÖ Requires 1 approval before merging
- ‚úÖ Requires all status checks to pass
- ‚úÖ Requires conversation resolution
- ‚úÖ No force pushes allowed
- ‚úÖ No direct pushes allowed
- ‚úÖ No branch deletion allowed

## üìù Commit Message Format

Following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation
- `style` - Code style
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `perf` - Performance
- `test` - Tests
- `chore` - Maintenance
- `ci` - CI/CD

### Example
```
feat(auth): add JWT token authentication

Implemented user authentication using JWT tokens.
Added middleware for token validation.
Updated user model with token fields.

Closes #123
```

## üöÄ Workflow Overview

```
1. Create branch following naming convention
   ‚Üì
2. Make changes and commit with conventional format
   ‚Üì
3. Push branch to GitHub
   ‚Üì
4. Create Pull Request using template
   ‚Üì
5. Automated checks run (branch name, commit format, etc.)
   ‚Üì
6. Request reviews from team members
   ‚Üì
7. Address feedback and make changes
   ‚Üì
8. Get required approvals
   ‚Üì
9. All checks pass and conversations resolved
   ‚Üì
10. Merge PR (squash merge for features)
   ‚Üì
11. Delete branch
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Next Steps for Repository Admin

### Critical: Set Up Branch Protection in GitHub UI

The branch protection rules need to be configured in GitHub's web interface. Follow these steps:

1. **Read the setup guide:**
   - Open `.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md`
   - Follow the step-by-step instructions

2. **Configure `main` branch protection:**
   - Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Add rule
   - Set branch name pattern: `main`
   - Enable required settings (see BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md)

3. **Configure `develop` branch protection:**
   - Create another rule for `develop`
   - Use slightly relaxed settings (1 approval instead of 2)

4. **Test the setup:**
   - Create a test PR
   - Verify protections are working
   - Verify automated checks run

### Optional: Additional Configuration

1. **Create `develop` branch** if it doesn't exist:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b develop
   git push origin develop
   ```

2. **Set up GitHub Discussions** (optional):
   - Enable in Settings ‚Üí Features
   - For questions and general discussions

3. **Configure GitHub Projects** (optional):
   - For project management and tracking

4. **Set up additional CI/CD** as needed:
   - Add build steps
   - Add test runners
   - Add deployment workflows

- [ ] Test PR created and all checks pass
- [ ] Team is notified about new rules
- [ ] Everyone has read BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md and CONTRIBUTING.md

## üéâ Benefits

This setup provides:

1. **Consistent workflow** - Everyone follows the same process
2. **Code quality** - Required reviews ensure quality
3. **Clean history** - Conventional commits make history readable
4. **Automated checks** - Catch issues early
5. **Clear documentation** - Easy onboarding for new contributors

- Update documentation as the project evolves
- Gather feedback from the team and adjust as needed
- Keep protection rules strict - easier to relax than tighten
