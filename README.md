## Development Workflow

1. **Create a branch** following our naming convention:
   - `feature/<feature-name>` for new features
   - `bugfix/<bug-name>` for bug fixes
   - `<username>/<feature-name>` for personal feature branches

2. **Make your changes** and commit regularly using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   git commit -m "fix: resolve login issue"
   ```

3. **Create a Pull Request** using our PR template

4. **Get reviews** from team members

5. **Merge** after approval and passing all checks

## Branch Protection

Our `main` and `develop` branches are protected with the following rules:

- ‚úÖ Require pull request reviews before merging
- ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass
- ‚úÖ Require conversation resolution
- ‚úÖ No force pushes allowed
- ‚úÖ No direct commits allowed

See [BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md](BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md) for complete details.

## Code Review Process

All pull requests require:

- At least **2 approvals** for merging to `main`
- At least **1 approval** for merging to `develop`
- All automated checks must pass
- All review conversations must be resolved

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the Conventional Commits specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:** feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, ci

**Example:**
```bash
feat(auth): add user login functionality

Implemented user authentication with JWT tokens.

Closes #123
```
